   HTTP stands for hyper text transfer protocol and it is used in client-server communication.By Using the HTTP we can send request to the 
   server and gets response from the server to the user.There was several stages of development of HTTP that was HTTP 1.1 was created in 1997
   and the other new one is created in 2015.

   
   HTTP 1.1: we can use request to the server through html page and get a response through html page.before sending the request and response 
   there is a connection TCP(transmission control protocol) established between the client and the server.There is a presistence connection 
   which means the several request and response are merged in a single connection.These are the drawbacks that leads to creation of HTTP 2
   the first problem was the all the request and response are send in a plain text form and the second problem was Head of line Blocking in 
   which the TCP connection is blocked all the request untill the response is recevied from the server.It uses request inlining for use getting 
   multiple pages.It compress data by itself.

   HTTP 2: It was developed over the SPDY protocol which is created for replace the HTTP.HTTP2 works on the binary framing layer insted of 
   textual that converts all the message in binary format.It works on fully multiplexed that is one TCP connection is used for multiple  
   request.It uses PUSH frame by server to collect all multiple pages.HTTP2 use the HPACK to compress the data.It has higher loading speed 
   while comparing to HTTP1.1



   
  2.Objects and its internal representation in Javascript:

    Objects in javascript are the most important datatype and it forms the building blocks of javascript.The Objects are quite different 
 from the javascript primitive datatypes like number,boolean,string,null,undefined,symbol.An Object is an reference datatypes and variables
 that are assigned a reference value are given a reference or pointer to that value.Objects in Javascript may be defined as the unordered 
 collection of related datatypes,of primitive or reference datatype, in the form of key:value pairs.These keys can be variable or function 
 and are called properties and methods respectively in the context of the object.An object can be created with figure brackets {...} with 
 an optional list of properties.
 A property is a Key:value ,pair where a key is a string also called as a property value and the value can be anything.javascript object 
 property can be a string or numbers.In case the property names are numbers it must be accessed with the bracket notation.
  
 syntax of object in javascript:
           
                           new object(value)
                           object(value)
                           let object_name = {
                           key_name:value,
                           .......    

                                 }        
                          

 An object can be with or without new both can create a new object.The javascript object is a collection of named values having state and
 behaviour.
